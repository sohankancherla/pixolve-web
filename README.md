## About The Project

Pixolve is an open-source API that offers AI-powered tools for image processing, along with a dedicated frontend UI. It currently includes two key features: Merge and Clean. The Merge feature combines similar images, selecting the best face for each individual, while the Clean feature groups images and assigns them a score out of 10. Users can then download images based on the score.
